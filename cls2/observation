1) ip - 192.168.43.130
   public ip - 14.139.208.84
   mac - b8:ca:3a:b2:e5:42
   subnet - 255.255.252.0
   gateway - 192.168.40.1

2) When we change any subfield of our ip, we will not be able to connect into the network as 
   a result of which we cant access the internet.

3) We can change the MAC address using macchanger, but we are unable to do so because of system 
   restrictions.

   sudo apt-get install macchanger
   macchanger --mac=b3:ca:3a:d2:e5:45

5) I have used port 5001, and the address is 127.0.0.1:5001 for the communication between the receiver and the sender.

6) I changed the receiver port to 5012 and the receiver is not able to receive the messages from the sender. So changing
   the port, disrupts the connection.

7) ping 127.0.0.1
